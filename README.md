# 10Clouds Front-end recruitment task

## Approach

My main approach to this task was to consider it as the start of a larger project that other developers could join and be ready to add new features. With this in mind, I chose the following technologies:

-   React - for building reactive, reusable components and excellent TS support
-   TypeScript - as a personal preference and since the typed code is more understandable, anyone working on the project will benefit from this choice
-   SCSS - for ease of usage and project global variables

Most components are reusable. Especially input components which can be used to build any form in the future.
Utility functions for validation and text formatting are modular and can be easily imported anywhere in the project.

Note: to be fair with my approach, I've added some basic tests for utility functions and for a few components. I know it wasn't mandatory
